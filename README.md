# Recipe and Shopping List using Angular 8
## Synopsis
This project is part of the "Angular 8 (formerly Angular 2) - The Complete Guide" course by Maximilian Schwarzmuller on Udemy (https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-guide-to-angular-2/). In this repository, I build upon the recipe and shopping list course project as I progress through the lectures.

The goal of this project is to develop a modern, complex, responsive, and scalable web application while gaining a deep understanding of Angular 8 fundamentals.

## Getting Started

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.2.0.

### Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

### Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

### Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

### Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

### Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
